\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This lab introduces fundamental operating system concepts by introducing the
\texttt{/proc} directory --
a virtual filesystem that provides access to process states.


\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}

The goals of this lab are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Process Monitoring via \texttt{/proc}:}
    To examine how a process executes and changes via the \texttt{/proc}
    virtual filesystem by directly inspecting its contents using CLI programs
    such as \texttt{cat}.
    \item \textbf{Executing POSIX System Calls in C:}
    To develop and test simple C programs that demonstrate the use of
    \texttt{fork()} and \texttt{exec()} system calls for process creation and control.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analysis of Log Files}\label{subsec:analysis-of-log-files}

\end{figure}
\noindent
The output of this log file shows a pattern of the process
sleeping for three seconds and then running for one.
This follows the behaviour of the code exactly as \texttt{calcloop}
is programmed to sleep for three seconds before each iteration.
\texttt{SysTm} stays at 0 for the entirety of the execution which is also
expected as the program does not operate in kernel mode at any point.
Finally, we see fairly intensive increases in \texttt{UsrTm} when the program is running.
This is due to CPU-intensive looping (400 million increments) each iteration which uses
exclusively user-space computation.
